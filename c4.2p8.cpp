// I have been at this code for some time now. I have been trying to get the graph class to work, and brush up on my knowledge of the list. This program is not finished because my class file keeps blowing up and this code blows up too.

#include <iostream>
#include "graph.cpp"
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int myStack = 7;
  int a[myStack] = {a,b,c,d,e,f,g};
  
  cout << a << " " << b << " " << c << " " << d << " " << e << " " << f << " " << g << endl;


  return 0;
}
